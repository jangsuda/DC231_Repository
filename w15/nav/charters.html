                    Koothrappali is an Indian-born
                    astrophysicist who lives in
                    Pasadena and works at Caltech.
                    Raj now also presents shows at
                    the Griffith Planetarium. For
                    a long time, Raj was unable to
                    talk to women due to a case of
                    selective mutism. Raj usually
                    needed a beer in his hand
                    before he could even talk to
                    women, including his close
                    friends.
