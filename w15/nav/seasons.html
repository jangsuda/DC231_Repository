                  Leonard hopes to make a good

                  inappropriate mission to tidy
                  Penny's apartment lands him and

                  2-6. The Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem
                </h3>
                <p>
                  When a young grad student,
                  Ramona Nowitzki, falls for
                  Sheldon, the whole gang is
                  confused - nobody more so than
                  Sheldon. Though Sheldon is
                  initially pleased to be the
                  subject of someone's adoration,
                  he is soon searching for a way
                  out of their "relationship".
